Google Drive for Linux*
############################

*this was built to support in house use, so it has not been fully tested with a range of distros/versions; however it is
basically a python wrapper for the google api and Rclone (https://rclone.org/) so maybe don't despair.

There are 2 basic ways to use this:
1. a panel applet that will streamline mounting google drives from rclone. (e.g. Gui)
2. a command line tool that will allow you to mount google drives from rclone. (e.g. Cli)
